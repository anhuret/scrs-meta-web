Hello,

Southern Cross is your number one pool for all your Cardano staking needs.

We are a team of experienced engineers dedicated to giving this project the best technical expertise.
Our extensive experience working for a large financial institution can really make a difference here.
Excellent technical skills of everyone involved will not just make a reliable staking pool for you,
it will also contribute to overall Cardano network health and stability.
We dedicated our free time for this project and brought to the table all the engineering knowledge we have.

Our day jobs, we spend doing DevOps, automation and cloud infrastructure design.
We strongly believe that Cardano pool should be run by people with appropriate technical skills.

We are still very young, born in epoch 275.
At the moment, the stake volume is not very high to bring this pool to its full potential.
Our immediate goal is to attract as many delegators as possible.
We hope that with our enthusiasm and your trust, we can all realise our ambition.

Our promise to you is to make this pool a secure fortress.
We'll keep it operational 24/7 365 with no downtime.

Thank you for your stake and support.
